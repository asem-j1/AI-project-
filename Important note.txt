Engineered an end-to-end pipeline to scrape and analyze Al Jazeera news content using NLP for programmatic labeling and CNN architectures for high-accuracy text classification. To optimize performance, the dataset was strategically capped at 1,000 samples per label to ensure a balanced training set and evaluated using the Macro-F1 score. This specific metric was selected to provide a robust assessment of model fairness by treating all classes equally, ensuring that precision and recall are optimized across the entire distribution rather than just majority classes.
